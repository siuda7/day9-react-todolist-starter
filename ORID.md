O: I learn about useContext and this hook allows you to access context values directly in your components without the need to pass props down through every level of the component tree. It simplifies state management when you need to share data across multiple components. And useReducers hook is used for managing state in a more predictable way, especially when dealing with complex state logic. It works similarly to Redux by using a reducer function that takes the current state and an action, then returns a new state

R: Fun

I: The way useContext eliminates the need for prop drilling, making your components cleaner and more maintainable.
How useReducer provides a structured way to handle state transitions, making your state logic more predictable and easier to debug. Understanding the reducer function: It requires a good grasp of how to structure your state and actions. Integrating useContext with useReducer: Combining these hooks can be tricky at first, but it offers a powerful way to manage global state with complex logic

D: Implement useContext: Use it to manage global state or shared data in your React applications, such as user authentication status, theme settings, or language preferences.
Use useReducer: Apply it in components where state logic is complex, such as forms with multiple fields, complex UI interactions, or managing state in a way that requires clear and predictable updates.
Combine useContext and useReducer: For a robust state management solution, use useContext to provide the state and dispatch function from useReducer to your components, allowing them to access and update the state as needed.
