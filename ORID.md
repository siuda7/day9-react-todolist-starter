O: I learned about calling backend APIs using axios in React and using the Ant Design component library for UI components.

R: I found it exciting to learn these new technologies.

I: I learned how axios simplifies making HTTP requests to backend APIs, allowing for easy integration with RESTful services. I also discovered the versatility of axios in handling different types of requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and managing responses. Additionally, I explored the ease of using Ant Design components to create a polished and professional-looking user interface. The wide range of pre-built components provided by Ant Design can significantly speed up the development process.

D: I plan to implement axios in my projects to make HTTP requests to backend APIs, handle responses, and manage errors effectively. I will use Ant Design components in my React applications to create a consistent and visually appealing UI. Furthermore, I will combine axios and Ant Design by fetching data from the backend using axios and displaying it using Ant Design components, ensuring a seamless integration between the frontend and backend.
